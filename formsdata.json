The work critically examines how these portrayals reinforce or subvert cultural perceptions of gender, empathy, and power. This project aims to uncover the recurring roles women inhabit in neo-noir‚Äîsuch as the femme fatale, the victim, the damsel in distress, and the survivor‚Äîand how these archetypes evolve across decades. It reflects on how their suffering is stylized and framed within the cinematic language of darkness, ambiguity, and psychological tension characteristic of the genre.",

    "project_description": "The GradEx work begins with a question that has haunted the history of visual culture: Why do the same images of women, passive, perfected, and posed, continue to repeat across centuries? Tracing a visual timeline from 17th to 19th century academic and salon traditions to today‚Äôs beauty magazines and social media aesthetics, this body of work reveals how entrenched ideals of femininity continue to shape how women are seen and represented.\n\nGuided by feminist critique and research, the work includes artist books, posters, prints, and postcards. Using both traditional and digital techniques, gel print transfers, collage, and hand-crafted textures are layered with digital design tools to create reproductions that expose the visual patterns that have persisted over time. These reproductions are not mere copies, but reimaginings that question the authority and legacy of historical imagery.\n\nBy merging analogue and contemporary media, the work explores how reproduction techniques can both expose and resist inherited narratives. It is not only a critique, but an effort to reclaim space for alternative representations, creating images that are more truthful, human, and free. This is a call to see differently and move beyond the gaze that has defined women for far too long. Through this body of work, women‚Äôs stories and bodies are reclaimed and reimagined, not as objects, but as subjects of their own power.",

Najeonchilgi is a traditional Korean craft known for its detailed floral patterns, symmetrical layouts, and iridescent textures set against black lacquered backgrounds. I reinterpreted this heritage technique digitally, applying its elements to Canadian landmarks like the CN Tower, Parliament Hill, and the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAs a Korean designer living in Canada, I aimed to reflect my personal experience of navigating two cultures. The project began with a series of digital posters that visually combine Korean decorative motifs with Canadian symbols. These posters were designed with symmetry and pastel tones on black backgrounds, evoking the elegance of najeonchilgi while introducing Canadian identity through landscapes and the beaver, Canada‚Äôs national animal.\n\nI printed the posters to explore materiality and tactility and created a handmade wooden box decorated in the same style. This box served as a tangible artifact, adding depth and texture to the project. The beaver character appears across both digital and physical outcomes, engaging in playful activities that connect cultural symbols with everyday life.\n\nThrough this work, I aimed to create a meaningful dialogue between Korean tradition and Canadian culture, showing how design can bridge histories and geographies in new and creative ways.",

Through real-time microphone input and audio analysis, the installation transforms live sound into visual form‚Äîallowing viewers to experience a sensory crossover that is usually internal and deeply personal. Color becomes responsive, fluid, and alive, shaped by the pitch, intensity, and complexity of surrounding sounds. Silence erases the image; noise gives it form.\n\nBy merging code with perception, this simulation offers a glimpse into a different way of sensing the world‚Äîwhere the boundary between hearing and seeing dissolves. It invites participants to consider how others experience reality, and how technology and design can bridge gaps in understanding what it means to feel, to sense, and to be. Graphic design is all about visual communication so in the end, I hope this doesn‚Äôt just simulate chromesthesia, I hope it creates a moment of empathy. A chance to see sound, not just hear it.",

    "project_description": "‚Äúsee the trees‚Äù is a collection of design artifacts that emerged from workshops focused on unlearning plant blindness, the phenomenon where humans don‚Äôt notice plants and trees around them and instead see them as a background or ‚Äústage setting‚Äù for animal activity. Each workshop is unique and follows different methods of making the design artifact, including collaborating on the design, each person arranging the order of the spreads and an asynchronous version. Together, the workshops were compiled into a toolkit that is available for everyone to follow at home and try facilitating their own workshop on unlearning plant blindness!",

    "project_description": "'Dear Toronto,' is a five-part video series that uses kinetic typography, illustration, and filmed footage to explore how nature impacts urban lifestyles in Toronto. This project began with a concern for rising numbers in loneliness, mental health challenges and a need for engagement within local communities. The series unfolds as a personal letter written to Toronto, expressing a \n\n'Biomimetic Design' is a web-based project investigating the intersection of graphic design and biomimicry, and how looking towards nature's already-found solutions offers an important perspective to visual communication. The site uses elements of pattern, colour, shape and sound to explore the systems of communication found in nature that are reflected in graphic design. This project posed the challenge of translating an ecosystem into an interface, allowing for an interactive archive that mirrors the complexity and harmony of the natural world.",

So my thesis consisted of two separate projects though if you need to use only one title (or put two separate titles) to fit the format of the post, please use \"Dear Toronto,\" first as it is my main thesis project. But \"Dear Toronto,\" and \"Biomimetic Design\" are two different projects. Pls let me know if theres any issues w/ aspect ratio as well. Thank you!"

    "project_description": "70 Days of Typography was a project in which I designed 70 different versions of the ampersand character as an exercise in type design and exploration. I chose to limit myself to designing these using only pencil and paper as a way to incorporate my personal sketching process, but also to push my design skills without the help of digital tools. I tried to balance both designs that were more illustrative and abstract, as well as some that could later be expanded into a full typeface.\n\nMy project on the tarantula hawk wasp is about portraying insects, specifically stinging hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), in a more empathetic and positive light. An area of debate of my topic that interested me was how insects are generally perceived and treated by people; I wanted to explore and challenge negative vs positive conceptions of these animals compared to others.\nThe goal of this project was to challenge the usually negative knee-jerk reaction towards insects and to instead foster a different kind of relationship towards them, whether it be fascination, respect, neutrality or other, to lead towards an understanding of their importance in our natural world. My initial project concept was a series of posters depicting various insects from the Schmidt pain index accompanied by the descriptions of their stings from the index and illustrative visual representations of these colourful descriptions, but I pivoted my outcome to accomplish my goal through a series of informational, explorational zines that can fold out into larger decorative posters.",
