The work critically examines how these portrayals reinforce or subvert cultural perceptions of gender, empathy, and power. This project aims to uncover the recurring roles women inhabit in neo-noir‚Äîsuch as the femme fatale, the victim, the damsel in distress, and the survivor‚Äîand how these archetypes evolve across decades. It reflects on how their suffering is stylized and framed within the cinematic language of darkness, ambiguity, and psychological tension characteristic of the genre.",

    "project_description": "The GradEx work begins with a question that has haunted the history of visual culture: Why do the same images of women, passive, perfected, and posed, continue to repeat across centuries? Tracing a visual timeline from 17th to 19th century academic and salon traditions to today‚Äôs beauty magazines and social media aesthetics, this body of work reveals how entrenched ideals of femininity continue to shape how women are seen and represented.\n\nGuided by feminist critique and research, the work includes artist books, posters, prints, and postcards. Using both traditional and digital techniques, gel print transfers, collage, and hand-crafted textures are layered with digital design tools to create reproductions that expose the visual patterns that have persisted over time. These reproductions are not mere copies, but reimaginings that question the authority and legacy of historical imagery.\n\nBy merging analogue and contemporary media, the work explores how reproduction techniques can both expose and resist inherited narratives. It is not only a critique, but an effort to reclaim space for alternative representations, creating images that are more truthful, human, and free. This is a call to see differently and move beyond the gaze that has defined women for far too long. Through this body of work, women‚Äôs stories and bodies are reclaimed and reimagined, not as objects, but as subjects of their own power.",

Najeonchilgi is a traditional Korean craft known for its detailed floral patterns, symmetrical layouts, and iridescent textures set against black lacquered backgrounds. I reinterpreted this heritage technique digitally, applying its elements to Canadian landmarks like the CN Tower, Parliament Hill, and the Rocky Mountains.\n\nAs a Korean designer living in Canada, I aimed to reflect my personal experience of navigating two cultures. The project began with a series of digital posters that visually combine Korean decorative motifs with Canadian symbols. These posters were designed with symmetry and pastel tones on black backgrounds, evoking the elegance of najeonchilgi while introducing Canadian identity through landscapes and the beaver, Canada‚Äôs national animal.\n\nI printed the posters to explore materiality and tactility and created a handmade wooden box decorated in the same style. This box served as a tangible artifact, adding depth and texture to the project. The beaver character appears across both digital and physical outcomes, engaging in playful activities that connect cultural symbols with everyday life.\n\nThrough this work, I aimed to create a meaningful dialogue between Korean tradition and Canadian culture, showing how design can bridge histories and geographies in new and creative ways.",

Through real-time microphone input and audio analysis, the installation transforms live sound into visual form‚Äîallowing viewers to experience a sensory crossover that is usually internal and deeply personal. Color becomes responsive, fluid, and alive, shaped by the pitch, intensity, and complexity of surrounding sounds. Silence erases the image; noise gives it form.\n\nBy merging code with perception, this simulation offers a glimpse into a different way of sensing the world‚Äîwhere the boundary between hearing and seeing dissolves. It invites participants to consider how others experience reality, and how technology and design can bridge gaps in understanding what it means to feel, to sense, and to be. Graphic design is all about visual communication so in the end, I hope this doesn‚Äôt just simulate chromesthesia, I hope it creates a moment of empathy. A chance to see sound, not just hear it.",

    "project_description": "70 Days of Typography was a project in which I designed 70 different versions of the ampersand character as an exercise in type design and exploration. I chose to limit myself to designing these using only pencil and paper as a way to incorporate my personal sketching process, but also to push my design skills without the help of digital tools. I tried to balance both designs that were more illustrative and abstract, as well as some that could later be expanded into a full typeface.\n\nMy project on the tarantula hawk wasp is about portraying insects, specifically stinging hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants), in a more empathetic and positive light. An area of debate of my topic that interested me was how insects are generally perceived and treated by people; I wanted to explore and challenge negative vs positive conceptions of these animals compared to others.\nThe goal of this project was to challenge the usually negative knee-jerk reaction towards insects and to instead foster a different kind of relationship towards them, whether it be fascination, respect, neutrality or other, to lead towards an understanding of their importance in our natural world. My initial project concept was a series of posters depicting various insects from the Schmidt pain index accompanied by the descriptions of their stings from the index and illustrative visual representations of these colourful descriptions, but I pivoted my outcome to accomplish my goal through a series of informational, explorational zines that can fold out into larger decorative posters.",

Together, the works question what is gained and lost in the pursuit of usability and corporate efficiency, and reflect on how design choices translate cultural shifts. \n",

That sharp little ache when you realize someone lived an entire life, and what‚Äôs left behind is only a sentence or two. A half-thought. It‚Äôs not about history, it‚Äôs about presence. About how memory clings to small things, and how ordinary moments become the ones that remain. I didn‚Äôt only want to preserve these postcards as artifacts. I wanted to listen to them. To let them speak again, in a new way. Through redaction, layering, and touch, I‚Äôve tried to uncover what‚Äôs already there, the fragments of memory and the fragility of time.

    "project_description": "How do we connect emotionally and sustainably to the cities we live in? üå±\n\nUrban Life explores this through two pieces centered on Toronto: a field guide to the Harbourfront and a student-focused housing app, Warmlee.\n\nThe Field Guide documents the rhythms of life at the Harbourfront of Toronto using photography, mapping, and observation. It highlights how weather, wildlife, and urban design intersect ‚Äî urging readers to see overlooked public spaces as vital to wellbeing and environmental balance.\nIt is ultimately about rethinking how we co-create sustainable living systems by learning about the overlooked aspects of some of Toronto‚Äôs natural spaces across Lake Ontario. By connecting the Field Guide to the housing application I am able to showcase a solution to physical problems and the importance of natural and often overlooked public spaces through digital (animation and application) and physical (Field Guide book and site research) mediums that encourage city navigation, exploration, and connection to others.\n\nTogether, the works blend reflection with functionality ‚Äî one helping us pause and observe, the other helping us move through the city with confidence. Both ask: how can design make urban life more thoughtful, livable, and human?",

    "project_name": "Reverie Blight / Video",
    "project_description": "It is difficult to say what I had intended in creating this short film. The process behind its making was one that was highly meditative, and that relied most on having to burrow into the recesses of my own (un)conscious mind, memories, and experiences. There is then a kind of emptiness that is meant to be evoked by the film, as it was made following a kind of existential breaking point that left me questioning what I had originally thought I knew about myself. The title of the film, which describes the decay and death of a fantasy and/or dream, serves to reflect how I have felt myself losing touch with my own dreams, and thus my own being.",
    "bio": "Zaid's practice straddles between many different disciplines, with illustration, writing, filmmaking, animation, publication design, 3D modeling, and web development being the most recurring. In creating any work, however, he retains the core objective of creating worlds and stories that are true to his own idiosyncrasies and individual experiences.",

    "project_name": "Shapes of Censorship",
    "project_description": "This project investigates the symbols, shapes, and motifs which have emerged from the censorship of Iranian artists and the suppression of Iranian culture. It examines how visual language develops under heavy restrictions, using abstraction, omission, and coded references as tools shaped by necessity. Drawing from both past and present examples, this work reflects how Iranian identity is altered and hidden as a result of government control. Every piece highlights aspects of culture and history which have been changed, silenced, and erased. ",
    "bio": "Pegah (she/her) is a Toronto based graphic designer with a Bachelor of Design from OCAD University. Her practice is rooted in print media, publication design, and tactile forms of communication. Her work is shaped by a strong connection to material processes and a deep interest in cultural identity, often reflecting her Iranian heritage and its vibrant design history. She is particularly inspired by experimental, place-based, and hands on approaches to design.",
