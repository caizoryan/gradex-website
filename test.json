  "project_description": "CERAMICS\n\nWORK 1 - gateway, 2024\nstoneware, glaze\n\ndescription for WORK 1\nGateway is my attempt at creating something that is both beautiful yet functional - it is sculpture and shelf at the same time. While the front is adorned with mirrored, yet not-exactly-symmetrical motifs, the back features space for shelving for your smallest, most prized possessions (a business at the front, party in the back type deal).\n\nWORK 2 - laptop, 2024\nstoneware, underglaze, glaze, ceramic decals\n\ndescription for WORK 2\nLaptop is simply a recreation of my everyday laptop that I have used throughout my entire undergrad, in ceramic form. \n\nWORK 3 - flasks, 2024 - 2025\nslip cast stoneware, glaze, ceramic decals\n\ndescription for WORK 3\nStarting from the same form over and over again, I employ a variety of surface techniques and designs to see the many different ways in which I can transform this singular object, creating my collection of Flasks that feel like they belong in the same family, but each have their own voice, remaining distinct from each other. \n____________\n\nPRINTMAKING\n\nWORK 4 - didn't i?, 2024 \nintaglio print\n\nWORK 5 - cigar-rat?, 2024\nlinoleum relief print\n\ndescription for WORK 4 + 5\nIn my printmaking practice, I am constantly drawn to depicting animals inspired by my online browsing habits. I take inspiration from memes that juxtapose cute and funny animal pictures with ironic text captions to create whole new layers of meaning and context.\n____________\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\n\nWORK 6 - image collector, 2024\nset of zines\n\ndescription for WORK 6\nIn this work, I seek to reflect upon the ever present and ongoing shift from physical to digital archives, as well as the relationship that we, as casual archivists, have with these newer methods of collecting. Using the built in search feature in the photos app, I look through, sort and organize the images which I have captured in my everyday life into recurring subjects, compiling them into a small collection of zines to create tangible artifacts that allow me to browse through my digital collection in a physical manner.\n",

  "comments": "I do not have a professional looking headshot, I hope the selfie is good enough, sorry in advance! Also hope that the descriptions are adequate, unsure if I was supposed to write whole artist statements for each individual piece. </3\n\nThank you for putting this together!",
